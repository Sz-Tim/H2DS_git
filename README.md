# H2DS_git

## Illustration of git and GitHub for H2 Data Science

This is a git repository ('repo') It is a folder that is being tracked by git.

Within this repository, we can choose which documents to track, and 'commit' versions that we want to store. The full history of these snapshots are stored and can be easily recovered in the future.

Each *commit* is required to have a message that should briefly describe what changed in this version. A *commit* can include multiple files, a single file, or selected lines from a file(s).

**Git** is a software program for tracking changes to a repository.

**GitHub** is a website for remote storage of git repositories. It is a popular place to share code-heavy work, and is increasingly used by academics to share the code and data for analyses associated with journal articles. Many R packages are also shared on GitHub. These need to be installed differently (i.e., you cannot use `install.packages()` but instead the easiest way is with `devtools::install_github()`).

RStudio is built to integrate nicely with git and GitHub. If you work regularly in R, it is a good idea to use these capabilities. There are fairly clear guides available online (e.g., [Happy git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/) or [R for the rest of us](https://rfortherestofus.com/2021/02/how-to-use-git-github-with-r/)).

## Download this repo

To download a copy of this repository, click the green "Code" button on the [GitHub repo](Sz-Tim/H2DS_git: Illustration of git and GitHub for H2 Data Science), then 'Download ZIP'. This will download the folder to your computer as "H2DS_git-main.zip". Note that this is a copy of the repo â€“ it is no longer connected to the original repo and changes will not be tracked.

Then, find the file on your computer, drag it to a suitable location, and then right click it and extract it.

## Switch to R

Next, double click the H2DS_git.Rproj file inside that folder to open RStudio. Open 'example.Rmd' and complete the exercise.
